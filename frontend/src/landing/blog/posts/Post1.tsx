        <BlogCopy paragraph>
            It's been a long road, but we have finally reached the launch date for Palavyr! Even so, this product is rich with incredible features you can use to create an amazing first impression for your
            customers! Let's take a look at a few features that stand out.

        <TitleCopy>Brand Customization</TitleCopy>
        <BlogCopy paragraph>
            One of the most important components to standing out online is your branding. When people see your branding they should immediately associate it with your business. The visual aesthetic of your
            business online is your brand colors. If they don't, you should reconsider your branding strategy! That's because brand recognition is what will help you spread your business to new customers and
            propagate awareness. It's all about branding!
        </BlogCopy>
        <BlogCopy paragraph>
            Branding isn't just about your logo either. It's about your fonts, your color palette, your taglines, and so much more. Palavyr lets you stay on brand by offering various types of customization.
            Using the chat demo customization tool, you can rebrand your Palavyr chat widget to use your taglines and colors. And, of course, when you write your conversations, you can infuse them with your
            brand's personality!

        <BlogCopy>Brand customization isn't the only feature you're going to love!</BlogCopy>

        <br></br>
        <TitleCopy>Fully customizable conversations</TitleCopy>
        <BlogCopy>
            This list would be utterly incomplete if we didn't mention the Palavyr Conversation editor! This is the heart and soul of Palavyr. One of the guiding principles behind Palavyr is that you, as a user
            of Palavyr and the person that wants a chat bot for their website, should have the ability to write your chat conversations. If you aren't in control of writing the chat text, but do decide what it
            says, then you likely have to rely on a programmer. Worse than that, you have to rely on the programmer to create the initial conversation, as well as to make any major or minor modifications!

        <BlogCopy>With Palavyr's conversation editor, you can log on and make an update to your chat any time you like. If you ask us, that's pretty powerful.</BlogCopy>

        <br></br>
        <TitleCopy>Enquiry Reviews</TitleCopy>
        <BlogCopy>
            We think you deserve to know when someone engages with your chat bot. That's why we've included an enquiry review page where you can visually inspect all of the conversations your users have had
            with your chat bot. We also think you deserve to learn something about your customers when they use your chat bot. You'll get all kinds of great insight into your customers enquiries, and if you
            stimulate users with a few cleverly designed questions, you can even learn a great deal about them as well.

        <TitleCopy>Configurable Email Responses</TitleCopy>
        <BlogCopy>
            There are few experiences online that are more frustrating than interacting with a chatbot that does. basically. nothing. Engagement shouldn't end with users finishing a chat and then deciding to
            scoot off to another website. When you use Palavyr, you also get the ability to send follow up emails. These emails can cary a lot of punch. Not only can you send a unique email for each chat area
            you configure, you can also send attachments with cost estimates.
        </BlogCopy>
        <BlogCopy>
            For many businesses, communicating a sense about how much services and goods <i>cost</i> is a delicate issue. Pricing can be highly customizable, making it difficult to provide relatively precise
            estimates without acquiring specific information from your potential clients. It can also be strategically withheld in order to prevent potential customers from being 'scared away'. Whatever the
            reason, Palavyr gives you the opportunity to specify <i>pricing strategies</i>, which will allow you to connect information gathered from a user to a fee. This gives you greater precision and
            control when creating fee estimates using your chat bot.

        <BlogCopy>These are just a few of the amazing things you will get access to when you join Palavyr.</BlogCopy>
